- Changed admin commands to be logged with embeds instead of regular messages (now you can watch the bot experience an embed fail!)
- Removed save_count and show_save from the command list (they were redundant). As compensation, the bot will now save the current count and timestamp every time a üçÑ is farmed (still doesnt fix the fact that the bot crashes every 5 hours with no way of backup xD)
- Made it so that any timestamps that are recorded are now recorded in SGT instead of the default UTC

30/6/2022
- Changed hosting from replit to railway (bot should no longer go down unless it encounters bugs)
- Updated README.txt to reflect the new changes
- Updated code to be able to save the timestamp to the data.json file (damn forgot to add strftime lol)
